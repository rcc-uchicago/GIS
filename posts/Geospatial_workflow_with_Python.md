Geospatial Data Science with Python

Description:

Geospatial data analysis is essential in fields like geography, urban planning, and environmental science. This detailed guide will demonstrate the capabilities of Python in handling geospatial data. From working with raster and vector data to conducting spatial operations and creating interactive maps, we will explore the world of GIS analysis using popular Python libraries.


Section 1: Introduction to Geospatial Data Analysis

Geospatial data contains geographic information crucial for understanding spatial relationships and patterns. This section will highlight the significance of geospatial data across various fields and the role Python plays in its analysis.


Section 2: GDAL and Rasterio Modules for Processing Raster Data

GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) and Rasterio are powerful Python modules for reading and writing raster data. We will delve into processing common raster formats like GeoTIFF and performing tasks such as resampling and reprojecting.


Section 3: Pyproj for Coordinate System Transformations

Coordinate system transformations are vital in geospatial analysis. With Pyproj, we can easily convert between different coordinate systems, simplifying tasks like converting latitude and longitude coordinates to UTM.


Section 4: Handling Geometric Objects with Shapely

Shapely is a useful Python module for managing geometric objects like points, lines, and polygons. We will learn how to create, manipulate, and conduct spatial operations on these objects to enhance our spatial analysis capabilities.


Section 5: Interactive Mapping with Folium

Folium is a versatile Python library for creating interactive maps. We will explore building interactive maps, adding markers and popups, and customizing map appearances to effectively visualize geospatial data.


Section 6: Reading and Writing Vector Data using Fiona

Fiona is a handy Python module for handling vector data. We will learn how to work with popular vector formats such as ESRI Shapefile and GeoJSON, as well as manipulate vector features' attributes.


Section 7: Utilizing OpenStreetMap Data with OSMnx

OSMnx provides tools for working with OpenStreetMap data in Python. We will discover how to download and manipulate street networks, buildings, and other geospatial data from OpenStreetMap for detailed spatial analysis.


Section 8: Spatial Statistics with Libpysal

Libpysal is a robust Python library for conducting spatial statistics and econometrics. We will cover topics like calculating spatial weights, conducting spatial autocorrelation tests, and estimating spatial econometric models for thorough spatial analysis.


Section 9: Geopandas for Managing Geospatial Data

Geopandas integrates geospatial data capabilities into Pandas DataFrames, allowing seamless manipulation of vector data. We will explore loading and manipulating vector data, performing spatial joins, and creating choropleth maps for insightful visualizations.


Section 10: Creating 3D Visualizations with Pydeck

Pydeck is a powerful tool for building interactive 3D maps in Python. We will explore creating engaging 3D point clouds, building models, and other immersive geospatial visualizations to enhance our analysis.


Section 11: Exploring Spatial Patterns with ESDA and LeafMap

ESDA (Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis) and LeafMap offer tools for analyzing spatial patterns in data. We will learn how to calculate spatial statistics like Moran's I, analyze local spatial autocorrelation, and create interactive choropleth maps for insightful visualizations.
